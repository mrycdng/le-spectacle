            <i>Images detached</i> from every aspect of life merge into a common <a href="#p2">
                <img class="sticky-img" id="sticky-img-4"></a>
            stream, and the former unity of life is
            lost for­ever. Apprehended in a partial way, reality unfolds in a new generality as a <i>pseudo-world</i>
            apart, solely
            as an object of contemplation. The tendency toward the <i>specialization</i> of <span><a href="#p2">
                    <img class="sticky-img" id="sticky-img-5"></a>images-of-the-world finds its highest
                expression in the world of the autonomous image, where deceit deceives itself. The spectacle in its
                generality <span><a href="#p2">
                        <img class="sticky-img" id="sticky-img-6"></a>is a concrete <i>inversion of life</i>, and, as
                    such, the autonomous movement of non-life.

                    The spectacle cannot be <a href="#p5">
                            <img class="sticky-img" id="sticky-img-7"></a>understood either as a delib­erate distortion
                        of the visual world <a href="#p5">
                                <img class="sticky-img" id="sticky-img-8"></a>or as a product
                            of the technology of the mass dissemination of images. It is far better viewed as a
                            weltanschauung that has
                            been actual­ized, translated into the material realm — a <i>world view</i> transformed into
                            an <i>objective force</i>.

                                    <img class="sticky-img" id="sticky-img-9"></a>dominant <i>mode of production</i>. It
                                is not something added to the real world — not a deco­rative element, so to speak. On
                                the
                                contrary, it is the very heart of society’s real <i>unreality</i>. In all its specific
                                manifesta­tions — <i>news</i> or
                                <i>propaganda</i>, <i>advertising</i> or the actual con­sumption of <i>entertainment</i>
                                — the spectacle epitomizes the prevailing
                                <i>model of <span><a href="#p6">
                                    <img class="sticky-img" id="sticky-img-10"></a>social life</i>. It is the <i>omnipresent cele­bration</i> of a
                                choice already made in the sphere of
                                produc­tion,
                                and the consummate result of that choice. In form as in content the spectacle serves as
                                total <i>justification</i>
                                for

                                presence of that justification, for it governs <span><a href="#p6">

                                The first phase of the <i>domination of the economy</i> over social life brought into
                                the

                                The present phase of total occupation of social life by the accumulated results of the
                                economy leads to <span><a href="#p17">
                                    <img class="sticky-img" id="sticky-img-16"></a>a  generalized sliding of having into <i>appearing</i>, from realization the obvious degradation of <i>being</i> into

                                “having” must draw its immediate prestige and its ultimate function. At the same time
                                all <i>individual reality</i> has become <i>social reality</i> directly dependent on
                                social power and
                                shaped by it. It is allowed to appear only to the extent that it is not.

                                This is the principle of <i>commmodity fetishism</i>, the domination of society by
                                “<i>intangible</i>
                                as well as tangible things,” which reaches its absolute fulfillment in the spectacle,
                                where the <i>tangible world</i> is <i>replaced</i> by a selection of <i>images</i> which
                                exist above it, and
                                which simultaneously impose themselves as the tangible par excellence.

                            The satisfaction which no longer comes from the use of abundant commodities is now sought in
                            the <i>recognition</i> of their <i>value</i> as commodities: the use of commodities becomes sufficient
                            unto itself; the consumer is filled with <i>religious fervor</i> for the sovereign liberty of the
                            commodities. <i>Waves of enthusiasm</i> for a given product, supported and spread by all the <i>media</i>
                            of communication, are thus propagated with lightning speed. A style of dress emerges from a
                            film; a magazine promotes night spots which launch various clothing fads. Just when the mass
                            of commodities slides toward puerility, the puerile itself becomes a special commodity; this
                            is epitomized by the gadget. We can recognize a mystical abandon to the transcendence of the
                            commodity in free gifts, such as key chains which are not bought but are included by
                            advertisers with prestigious purchases, or which flow by exchange in their own sphere. One
                            who collects the key chains which have been manufactured for collection, accumulates the
                            indulgences of the commodity, a glorious sign of his real presence among the faithful.
                            Reified man advertises the proof of his <i>intimacy with the commodity</i>. The fetishism of
                            commodities reaches moments of fervent exaltation similar to the ecstasies of the
                            convulsions and miracles of the old religious fetishism. The only use which remains here is
                            the fundamental use of submission.
