            itself as an immense accumulation of<i>spectacles</i>.
            All that once <span><a href="#p1">
                <img class="sticky-img" id="sticky-img-3">
            </a></span>was directly lived has become mere <i>representation</i>.

            <h1>II</h1>
            <i>Images detached</i> from every aspect of life merge into a common <a href="#p2">
                <img class="sticky-img" id="sticky-img-4"></a>
                stream, and the former unity of life is
            lost for­ever. Apprehended in a partial way, reality unfolds in a new generality as a <i>pseudo-world</i> apart, solely
            as an object of contemplation. The tendency toward the <i>specialization</i> of <span><a href="#p2">
                <img class="sticky-img" id="sticky-img-5"></a>images-of-the-world finds its highest
            expression in the world of the autonomous image, where deceit deceives itself. The spectacle in its
            generality <span><a href="#p2">
                <img class="sticky-img" id="sticky-img-6"></a>is a concrete <i>inversion of life</i>, and, as such, the autonomous movement of non-life.

            <h1>V</I></h1>
            The spectacle cannot be <span><a href="#p5">
                <img class="sticky-img" id="sticky-img-7"></a>understood either as a delib­erate distortion of the visual world <span><a href="#p5">
                    <img class="sticky-img" id="sticky-img-8"></a>or as a product
            of the technology of the mass dissemination of images. It is far better viewed as a weltanschauung that has
            been actual­ized, translated into the material realm — a <i>world view</i> transformed into an <i>objective force</i>. 
            <br><br>
            <span id="p6"></span>
            <h1>VI</h1>
            6. Understood in its totality, the spectacle is both the outcome and the goal of the <span><a href="#p6">
                <img class="sticky-img" id="sticky-img-9"></a>dominant <i>mode of production</i>. It is not something added to the real world — not a deco­rative element, so to speak. On the
            contrary, it is the very heart of society’s real <i>unreality</i>. In all its specific manifesta­tions — <i>news</i> or
            <i>propaganda</i>, <i>advertising</i> or the actual con­sumption of <i>entertainment</i> — the spectacle epitomizes the
            prevailing
            <i>model of social life</i>. It is the <i>omnipresent cele­bration</i> of a choice already made in the sphere of
            produc­tion,
            and the consummate result of that choice. In form as in content the spectacle serves as total <i>justification</i>
            for
            the conditions and aims of the existing system. It further ensures <i>permanent</i> presence of that
            justification,
            for it governs almost all time spent outside the production process itself.

            15. As the indispensable <i>packaging</i> for things produced as they are now produced, as a general <i>gloss</i> on the
            ration­ality of the system, and as the advanced <i>economic sector</i> directly responsible for the <i>manufacture</i> of
            an
            ever-growing mass of <i>image-objects</i>, the spectacle is the chief <i>product</i> present-day society.
