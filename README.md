# lespectacle
“Le Spectacle” is Project #1 of a Winter 2026 web design course, with the project prompt “collection”. 
As a critique of commodity-fetishism, tension is created by juxtaposing images from Bendito Mockup’s collection “Les Basics” with excerpts from Guy Debord’s The Society of The Spectacle.
